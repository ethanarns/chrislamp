<h1 id="welcome-to-arns-carpet-cleaning">Welcome to Arns Carpet Cleaning</h1>
<p>We are a local business with years of experience, proud to serve the community. Our services:</p>
<h3 id="carpet-cleaning">Carpet Cleaning</h3>
<p>We use the low moisture bonnet method. It&#39;s been shown to clean as well as steam cleaning and other methods.</p>
<p>Your carpets will look clean and fresh without high dry times and without damaging the carpet and pad with excessive moisture. We also clean area rugs and carpeted stairs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Our method is better than steam cleaning because</strong>: If steam cleaning is done improperly carpets can get irreparably damaged and it doesn&#39;t clean any better despite being more dangerous. Also, steam cleaners run on gasoline and emit green house gasses.</li>
<li><strong>Our method is better than encapsulation because</strong>: Although it does encapsulate some of the soil, it also encapsulates carpet fibers. This results in your carpet becoming sticky and getting dirty faster.</li>
<li><strong>Our method is better than shampooing because</strong>: Similar to encapsulation, shampoo leaves carpets susceptible to getting dirtier carpets faster, because it&#39;s not possible to remove all the shampoo. This once again leaves your carpet sticky.</li>
</ul>
